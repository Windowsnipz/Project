# Zomboid: Rosewood Rising
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

Welcome to my final project for CS50x! This is a command line game, inspired by the very popular Project Zomboid. Project Zomboid (PZ) is a hardcore survival game set in a zombie apocalypse. In my project, I wanted to capture this setting in a text-based adventure game! 

Zomboid: Rosewood Rising starts with a simplistic menu screen, in which the player chooses whether or not to start the game. Upon starting, the introduction to the story in path1.py is executed, and the player will be prompted to enter a name for their survivor. My get_character_name() function in helpers.py was fairly simple to implement. Basically, it makes sure that (1.) the name is not empty and (2.) the name does not match existing characters in the story.

This introduction will always be the first scenario the player encounters.





# Personal Notes (delete before submission)

What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game will be a text-based adventure game executed in python. The game will feature an engaging story, random elements, and text inputs from the user.

What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I'll need to gain skills in game development and making a functional appilication in python.

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome? 
1. A good outcome for my project is a functional game that will output an interesting story, and the user can input text decisions to determine outcomes of the game
2. A better outcome would be to implement features of randomness to add more storylines and enhance replayability of the game.
3. The best outcome is to create a game with a large scope, implement multiple storylines/characters, and package the game into an executable to distribute to friends.
